The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, located in the Coral Sea off the coast of Queensland, Australia. Stretching over 2,300 kilometers and consisting of more than 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands, it is the only living structure visible from space.

The reef is home to an incredible diversity of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, and various species of sharks, sea turtles, and seabirds. It plays a crucial role in marine biodiversity and supports a wide range of ecological functions.

The Great Barrier Reef faces numerous threats, such as climate change, coral bleaching, pollution, and overfishing. In recent years, rising ocean temperatures have caused widespread bleaching events, which weaken and sometimes kill coral.

Efforts to preserve the reef include marine protected areas, sustainable tourism practices, and scientific research aimed at understanding and mitigating environmental impacts. The Australian government and various conservation organizations are actively involved in protecting this natural wonder.
