LLM Model Comparison for Domain-Specific Use Cases
===================================================

1. LLaMA 3 (Meta)
-----------------
- Best Domains: General, Legal, Insurance, Programming (light)
- Strengths: Strong reasoning, long context (8K–128K), fluent output
- Weaknesses: Occasional hallucination, not the most efficient for small devices
- Resource Usage: Moderate (runs fine on CPU with quantization)
- Summary: Best all-rounder for general use and reasoning tasks

2. CodeLLaMA
------------
- Best Domains: Programming (Python, JS, Bash), Light Math
- Strengths: Syntax precision, good code generation, understanding of logic
- Weaknesses: Can hallucinate APIs or return incorrect output in long completions
- Resource Usage: High (7B–34B, GPU recommended)
- Summary: Best for developers and programming tasks

3. Mistral
----------
- Best Domains: General, Math, Legal (basic), Insurance
- Strengths: Logical, very efficient, compact, fast inference
- Weaknesses: Hallucinates more than LLaMA in abstract tasks
- Resource Usage: Low to Moderate (7B fits most systems)
- Summary: Compact, powerful choice for general use

4. Gemma 3 (Google)
-------------------
- Best Domains: General, Science (basic), Chatbots
- Strengths: Dialogue flow, summarization, safety alignment
- Weaknesses: May skip factual consistency, weaker at deep logic
- Resource Usage: Very low (2B/7B), good CPU support
- Summary: Best for lightweight systems and safe conversations

5. Phi (Microsoft)
------------------
- Best Domains: Education, Logic/Math, Reasoning
- Strengths: Strong math reasoning, logic, textbook-style QA
- Weaknesses: Hallucinates on open-ended or broad factual queries
- Resource Usage: Very low (1.3B–3.8B)
- Summary: Great for low-resource devices and math-heavy tasks

6. DeepSeek
-----------
- Best Domains: Programming, Math, Science
- Strengths: Excellent at math, code, scientific reasoning
- Weaknesses: Resource-heavy, especially in larger variants
- Resource Usage: High (7B–67B, best on GPU)
- Summary: Ideal for code + math + scientific content

7. Qwen (Alibaba)
-----------------
- Best Domains: General, Legal (basic), Insurance, Multilingual
- Strengths: Fluent, multilingual, handles long-context
- Weaknesses: Hallucinates more in abstract/open-ended prompts
- Resource Usage: Moderate to High
- Summary: Great for multilingual apps and context-heavy use
